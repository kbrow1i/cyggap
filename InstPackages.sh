# 
#   libXaw.so, libXmu.so, libXt.so, libXext.so, libX11.so, libSM.so, libICE.so
# 
# In addition you need on XFree Version >= 4:
# 
#   libXpm.so
#
# If you  miss one of  these under Linux you  can usually just  install some
# more packages of your favorite distribution. The development files usually
# come in some package with "dev" in its name.
